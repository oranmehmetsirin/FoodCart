# FoodCart

A food basket project.

The project is carried out by pulling data through a created Json-Server.

In the project created with Vite-React, edits were made with the help of Tailwind.

The project was also built using React-Router-Dom, Axios, Redux, React-Redux, Redux-Thunk and React-Icons on it.

Below is a small visual of the project.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- 
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
